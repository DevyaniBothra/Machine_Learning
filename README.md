# Machine_Learning
I worked on Air_bnb datasrt, where my major task was to analyze the change in price of rooms as per the given information in data.
I started with basic EDA analysis and found the co-relation between the factors.
After that I applied different algorithms for my problem, while using a hold-out “test set” of data to evaluate performance 
and select the winner.
